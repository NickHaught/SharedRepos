Hello, my name is Kyria Blough. I am a Senior Computer Science Major, Graphic Design Minor, at Marietta College. 
I will bring several strengths to a software development group.
First, I always get my programs done in time. 
Second, I am willing to work on a problem until it gets solved, no matter how long it takes.
Third, I am willing to take charge if needed, or be a supportive group member, whichever role I need to fill.
